### 1. In Firebase Console, go to Authentication > Sign-in method, enable Phone sign-in, and click Save.

### 2. To add SHA1 and SHA256 keys in Firebase, go to the **android** folder, right-click the **gradlew** file, and select **"Open in Terminal"** as shown in the image below.

### 3. In the terminal view, run `gradlew signingReport` (on **Windows**), or `./gradlew signingReport` (on **Mac/Linux**) as shown below.

### 4. Now take debug sha and sha256 will print copy that and add it in firebase console. And also add sha-256 to firebase console.

 **Remember:**

- When releasing the APK, you must add the **release SHA1** in the Firebase console; otherwise, **OTP verification won't work**. After release, you can get the SHA1 from the **Play Console** under the **App Integrity** section.

### 5. Alternatively, you can get the **release SHA** using the command line:

1. Open **Run**, type `cmd`, and press Enter.
2. Navigate to the **Java JDK `bin` path** in the terminal.
3. Run the following command (replace the keystore path and alias):
   ```
   keytool -list -v -keystore "D:\keystore\eShop.jks" -alias eShop
   ```
4. Enter the keystore password when prompted â€” it will display your **release SHA1**.

### 6. For ios you need to set following.

**Add custom URL schemes to your Xcode project:**
- Open your project configuration: double-click the project name in the left tree view. Select your app from the TARGETS section, then select the Info tab, and expand the URL Types section.
- Click the + button, and add a URL scheme for your reversed client ID. To find this value, open the GoogleService-Info.plist configuration file, and look for the REVERSED_CLIENT_ID key. Copy the value of that key, and paste it into the URL Schemes box on the configuration page. Leave the other fields blank.
- When completed, your config should look something similar to the following (but with your application-specific values):
